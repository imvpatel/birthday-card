       -A stylish, interactive Birthday Greeting Card created using pure HTML and CSS. This project showcases how to design a responsive and       
      animated card with smooth transitions, hover effects, and clickable anchor-based sections for sending or sharing.
 
🧠 Features:-

   ✅ Animated Greeting Card: A clean, responsive card with hover effects and emojis using ::before and ::after.
   ✅ Internal Navigation: Buttons that jump to different card statuses using anchor tags (#send, #share).
   ✅ Smooth Interactions:
       -Card grows and changes color on hover.
       -Links change color on hover, focus, and active states.
       -Targeted sections appear only when navigated to.
   ✅ Fully Responsive Design: Looks great on desktop and mobile.

🛠️ Technologies Used:-
   
   -HTML5 for structure
   -CSS3 for design, transitions, and animations

💡 How It Works:-

   -The Greeting Card is centered on the page with a birthday message and two links: "Send Card" and "Share on Social Media."
   -When clicked, each link scrolls to its corresponding <section> (#send, #share) and displays a message using the :target pseudo-class.
   -CSS hover and transition effects are used for engaging animations.
   -The card scales and changes color when hovered, and the links are interactive with visual feedback on focus, visit, hover, and active.
